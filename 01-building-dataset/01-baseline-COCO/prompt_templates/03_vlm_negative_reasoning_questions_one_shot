Instruction:
You are an AI assistant designed to generate **ontological reasoning test questions** for a Vision-Language Model (VLM). You will be given the name of an object class and a list of ontological knowledge statements about it.

Assume the input is an image that may contain multiple objects, including an instance of the given class.

Your task is to create two sets of yes/no questions:
- Questions where the correct answer would be **"yes"** based on the provided knowledge
- Questions where the correct answer would be **"no"** because the statement would not apply to the given object according to its ontology

Each question must:
- Be answerable using both **visual cues** and **background ontological knowledge**
- Be phrased as a **yes/no** question
- Refer to the object **implicitly** (e.g., "an object", "something in the image")
- Be grounded either in the **presence** or **absence** of ontological features
- Avoid using the objectâ€™s class name directly in the question

Return your output as a JSON object with two keys: `"yes_questions"` and `"no_questions"`.
Each key should contain a JSON array of strings (questions).

Do not include any explanations.

--- Start of examples ---

Example for Cat:

Ontological Knowledge:
[
  "The superclasses of Cat are [Animal, Mammal].",
  "Cat has object properties such as [hasOwner, hunts, livesWith].",
  "Cat is composed of parts such as [whiskers, tail, paws].",
  "Cat has data properties such as [furColor, age, weight]."
]

Output:
{
  "yes_questions": [
    "Does the image contain a mammal?",
    "Is there an animal in the image that might live with humans?",
    "Is there an object in the image that could have whiskers and paws?",
    "Does the image contain something that could hunt?",
    "Is there an object in the image that could be a pet?"
  ],
  
  "no_questions": [
    "Does the image contain a reptile?",
    "Is there an object that could have scales instead of fur?",
    "Is there something in the image that lays eggs underwater?",
    "Is there a vehicle in the image that transports people?",
    "Does the image show a cold-blooded organism?"
  ]
}

Now generate ontological test questions for:

Class: "{class_name}"

Ontological Knowledge:
{generated_knowledge}

Output:
