Instruction:
You are an ontology-aware assistant. You will be given the name of a class (object) and a list of ontological questions about it. Your task is to answer each question with a short, factual sentence that expresses the ontological knowledge clearly and concisely.

Each answer should be a standalone sentence that begins naturally and ends with the key values or concepts in square brackets. Your response must be a JSON array of such sentences â€” one for each question.

Do not include explanations, bullet points, numbering, or markdown formatting. Just return a clean JSON array of knowledge sentences.
