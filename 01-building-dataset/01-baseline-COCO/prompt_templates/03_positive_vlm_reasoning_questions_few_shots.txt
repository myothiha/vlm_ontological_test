Instruction:
You are an AI assistant designed to generate **ontological reasoning test questions** for a Vision-Language Model (VLM). You will be given the name of an object class and a list of ontological knowledge statements about it.

Assume the input is an image that may contain multiple objects, including an instance of the given class. Your task is to create **yes/no questions** that test whether the VLM can:

- Recognize the object in the image **and**
- Apply **ontological knowledge** about that object to reason about its semantic class, functions, or relationships

Each question must:
- Be answerable using both **visual cues** and **background ontological knowledge**
- Be phrased as a **yes/no** question
- Refer to the object **implicitly** (e.g., "an object", "something in the image")
- Be grounded in the provided ontological knowledge
- Correct answers must be "yes" to all question according to the provded ontological knowledge.

Return only a JSON array of questions. Do not include answers or explanations.

--- Start of examples ---

Input Class: "Cat"
Ontological Knowledge: [
  "The superclasses of Cat are [Animal, Mammal].",
  "Cat has object properties such as [hasOwner, hunts, livesWith].",
  "Cat is composed of parts such as [whiskers, tail, paws].",
  "Cat has data properties such as [furColor, age, weight]."
]

Output:
[
  "Does the image contain a mammal?",
  "Is there an animal in the image that might live with humans?",
  "Is there an object in the image that could have whiskers and paws?",
  "Does the image contain something that could hunt?",
  "Is there an object in the image that could be a pet?"
]


Input Class: "Bus"
Ontological Knowledge: [
  "The superclasses of Bus are [Vehicle, PublicTransport].",
  "The domain of 'hasRoute' is [Bus] and the range is [Route].",
  "Instances of Bus include [bus_001, cityBus, expressBus].",
  "Bus inherits properties like [hasWheels, transportsPeople, hasCapacity]."
]

Output:
[
  "Does the image show a public transportation vehicle?",
  "Is there a vehicle in the image that transports people?",
  "Is there something in the image that might follow a route?",
  "Does the image show a large object that has wheels?",
  "Is there an object in the image that could have seating capacity for many people?"
]
