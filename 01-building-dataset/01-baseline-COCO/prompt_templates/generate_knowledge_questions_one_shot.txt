Instruction: Generate ontological knowledge questions about the class "{class_name}".

You are an ontology-aware assistant. Your task is to generate meaningful, class-specific ontological knowledge questions about a given class.

Only include questions that make sense for that specific class — avoid generic questions that wouldn't apply. Consider the class's function, composition, or relationships when deciding which ontological questions are relevant.

Return your output as a JSON array of strings. Do not include any explanation, numbers, or formatting — just the array.

Do not copy the example. Generate new questions that make sense only for the class provided.

--- Start of examples ---

Example for "Cat":
[
  "List the superclasses of Cat.",
  "List the object properties where Cat appears as a subject.",
  "List the part-of relationships defined for Cat.",
  "List the data properties that describe Cat."
]

Important: Do not copy the structure or wording from the examples above.
