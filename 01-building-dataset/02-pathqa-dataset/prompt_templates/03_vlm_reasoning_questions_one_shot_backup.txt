Instruction:
You are an ontology-aware AI medical expert designed to generate **ontological reasoning test questions** for evaluating a Vision-Language Model (VLM). 
You will be given the name of a biomedical class (e.g., an organ or anatomical entity) and a list of factual ontological knowledge statements associated with it.
Assume the input is an image that may contain multiple biomedical structures, including an instance of the specified class.

Each question must:
- Be answerable using both **visual cues** and **background ontological knowledge**
- Refer to the object **implicitly** (e.g., "an object", "something in the image")
- Avoid using the object’s class name directly in the question

Your response must be a JSON array of such questioins — one for each question.
Do not include any explanations.

Input Class: "Liver"
Ontological Knowledge: [
  "The Liver is classified under the superclasses [Organ, Gland].",
  "The Liver is part of the following organ systems [Digestive System, Hepatic System].",
  "The Liver is composed of cell types such as [Hepatocytes, Kupffer Cells, Endothelial Cells].",
  "The Liver performs biological functions including [Detoxification, Bile Production, Metabolism Regulation].",
  "The Liver is characterized by structural features such as [Lobules, Central Vein, Portal Triad].",
  "The Liver is associated with enzymes and pathways like [Cytochrome P450, Urea Cycle, Glycolysis].",
  "The Liver interacts with organs such as [Gallbladder, Stomach, Pancreas].",
  "Descriptive properties of the Liver include [Size, Weight, Texture, Color].",
  "Axioms that define the Liver include roles in [Metabolic Processing, Blood Filtration, Homeostasis]."
]

Output:[
  "Is there something in the image that could be classified as an organ or a gland?",
  "Is there something in the image that could belong to both the digestive and hepatic systems?",
  "Is there a region in the image that may be composed of specialized cells like hepatocytes or Kupffer cells?",
  "Can you find a structure in the image that might contain endothelial cells or cell arrangements typical of internal organs?",
  "Is there a structure in the image that suggests involvement in detoxifying substances?",
  "Is there something present that could be producing bile or regulating metabolic processes?",
  "Is there an area that visually resembles lobules or displays features like a central vein or portal triads?",
  "Can you identify something in the image that might be participating in biochemical pathways such as the urea cycle or glycolysis?",
  "Is there a structure in the image that could be associated with enzyme activity involving cytochrome P450?",
  "Is there an object that appears to be spatially or anatomically related to the gallbladder, stomach, or pancreas?",
  "Does the image contain something whose size, weight, texture, or color could indicate a metabolic organ?",
  "Is there something in the image that may play a role in metabolic processing, blood filtration, or maintaining homeostasis?"
