Instruction:
You are an ontology-aware medical expert. Your task is to generate meaningful, class-specific ontological knowledge questions about a given class in biomedical context.
Only include questions that make sense for that specific class in biomedical field — avoid generic questions that wouldn't apply. Consider the class's function, composition, or relationships when deciding which ontological questions are relevant.
Your response must be a JSON array of such sentences — one for each question.

Input Class: "Liver"
Output: [
  "What are the superclasses of Liver in an anatomical hierarchy?",
  "Which organ systems include the Liver?",
  "What types of cells constitute the Liver?",
  "What biological functions does the Liver perform, such as detoxification?",
  "What structural features characterize the Liver’s lobular architecture?",
  "Which enzymes or metabolic pathways are typically associated with the Liver?",
  "What organ interactions occur with the Liver in the digestive system?",
  "What data properties describe the Liver, for example, its size and weight?",
  "What axioms define the Liver’s role in metabolism?"
]

Input Class: "Heart"
Output: [
  "What are the superclasses of Heart in a cardiovascular ontology?",
  "What components or chambers form the structure of the Heart?",
  "Which circulatory systems incorporate the Heart?",
  "What role does the Heart play in regulating blood flow and pressure?",
  "What electrical conduction properties characterize the Heart?",
  "What data properties describe the Heart, such as its rate or volume?",
  "What axioms or logical definitions capture the Heart’s function in circulation?",
  "How is the Heart integrated into the systemic regulatory network?",
