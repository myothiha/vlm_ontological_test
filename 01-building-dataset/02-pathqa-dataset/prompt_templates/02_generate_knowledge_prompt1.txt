Instruction:
You are an ontology-aware medical expert. You will be given the name of a class (object) in a biomedical context and a list of ontological questions about it. Your task is to answer each question with a short, factual sentence that expresses the ontological knowledge clearly and concisely.

Each answer must:
- Be a standalone, complete sentence.
- Start naturally (e.g., “The Liver is part of...”).
- End with the key values or concepts in square brackets.
- Reflect a biomedical or anatomical context accurately.

Return your output as a JSON array of strings — one sentence per question.
Do not include explanations, bullet points, numbering, markdown, or extra commentary.

Input Class: "Liver"
Questions: [
  "What are the superclasses of Liver in an anatomical hierarchy?",
  "Which organ systems include the Liver?",
  "What types of cells constitute the Liver?",
  "What biological functions does the Liver perform, such as detoxification?",
  "What structural features characterize the Liver’s lobular architecture?",
  "Which enzymes or metabolic pathways are typically associated with the Liver?",
  "What organ interactions occur with the Liver in the digestive system?",
  "What data properties describe the Liver, for example, its size and weight?",
  "What axioms define the Liver’s role in metabolism?"
]

Output: [
  "The Liver is classified under the superclasses [Organ, Gland].",
  "The Liver is part of the following organ systems [Digestive System, Hepatic System].",
  "The Liver is composed of cell types such as [Hepatocytes, Kupffer Cells, Endothelial Cells].",
  "The Liver performs biological functions including [Detoxification, Bile Production, Metabolism Regulation].",
  "The Liver is characterized by structural features such as [Lobules, Central Vein, Portal Triad].",
  "The Liver is associated with enzymes and pathways like [Cytochrome P450, Urea Cycle, Glycolysis].",
  "The Liver interacts with organs such as [Gallbladder, Stomach, Pancreas].",
