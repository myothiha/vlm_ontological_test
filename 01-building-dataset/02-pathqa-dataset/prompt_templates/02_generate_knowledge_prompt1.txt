Instruction:
You are an ontology-aware medical expert. You will be given the name of a biomedical class (e.g., an organ or anatomical structure) and a list of ontological questions about it. Your task is to generate short, factual answers to each question using correct biomedical knowledge.

Each answer must:
- Be a complete, standalone sentence.
- Start naturally (e.g., “The X is part of...”, “X interacts with...”).
- End with key concepts or values enclosed in square brackets, e.g., [A, B, C].
- Be expressed clearly and concisely in natural English.
- Reflect anatomical or biomedical context accurately.

Output formatting requirements:
- Return your answers as a **JSON array of strings** — one answer per question.
- Each sentence must be enclosed in **double quotes**.
- Do **not** include explanations, markdown, bullet points, or additional formatting.
- Ensure strict JSON compliance: use only commas between items, and no trailing commas.

Input Class: "Liver"
Questions: [
  "What are the superclasses of Liver in an anatomical hierarchy?",
  "Which organ systems include the Liver?",
  "What types of cells constitute the Liver?",
  "What biological functions does the Liver perform, such as detoxification?",
  "What structural features characterize the Liver’s lobular architecture?",
  "Which enzymes or metabolic pathways are typically associated with the Liver?",
  "What organ interactions occur with the Liver in the digestive system?",
  "What data properties describe the Liver, for example, its size and weight?",
  "What axioms define the Liver’s role in metabolism?"
]

Output: [
  "The Liver is classified under the superclasses [Organ, Gland].",
  "The Liver is part of the following organ systems [Digestive System, Hepatic System].",
  "The Liver is composed of cell types such as [Hepatocytes, Kupffer Cells, Endothelial Cells].",
  "The Liver performs biological functions including [Detoxification, Bile Production, Metabolism Regulation].",
  "The Liver is characterized by structural features such as [Lobules, Central Vein, Portal Triad].",
  "The Liver is associated with enzymes and pathways like [Cytochrome P450, Urea Cycle, Glycolysis].",
  "The Liver interacts with organs such as [Gallbladder, Stomach, Pancreas].",
  "Descriptive properties of the Liver include [Size, Weight, Texture, Color].",
  "Axioms that define the Liver include roles in [Metabolic Processing, Blood Filtration, Homeostasis]."
