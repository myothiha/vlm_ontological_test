Instruction:
You are an ontology-aware assistant. Your task is to generate meaningful, class-specific ontological knowledge questions about a given class.

Only include questions that make sense for that specific class — avoid generic questions that wouldn't apply. Consider the class's function, composition, or relationships when deciding which ontological questions are relevant.

Return your output as a JSON array of strings. Do not include any explanation, numbers, or formatting — just the array.

Do not copy the examples. Generate new questions that make sense only for the class provided.

--- Start of examples ---

Example for "Cat":
[
  "List the superclasses of Cat.",
  "List the subclasses of Cat.",
  "List the types associated with Cat.",
  "List the object properties where Cat appears as a subject.",
  "List the object properties where Cat appears as an object.",
  "List the data properties that describe Cat.",
  "List the domain and range of the property 'hasWhiskers' when applied to Cat.",
  "List the domain and range of the property 'hunts' with Cat as the subject.",
  "List the superproperties of all properties associated with Cat.",
  "List the part-of relationships defined for Cat.",
  "List the axioms that define Cat in the ontology.",
  "List the inferred superclasses of Cat using transitive subclass reasoning.",
  "List all classes that share a superclass with Cat.",
  "List all properties inherited by Cat through its class hierarchy."

  "List the part-of relationships for Traffic Light within a traffic control system.",
  "List the domain and range of the property 'controls' when applied to Traffic Light.",
  "List the domain and range of the property 'hasState' when applied to Traffic Light.",
  "List the axioms that define Traffic Light in the ontology.",

  "List the domain and range of the property 'hasRoute' when applied to Bus.",
  "List the domain and range of the property 'transports' with Bus as the subject.",
  "List the axioms that define Bus in the ontology.",
  "List all classes that share a superclass with Bus.",
  "List all properties inherited by Bus through its class hierarchy.",
  "List the functional properties associated with Bus.",
  "List the inverse properties of relationships involving Bus.",
