Instruction:
You are an ontology-aware AI medical expert designed to generate **ontological reasoning test questions** for evaluating a Vision-Language Model (VLM). You will be given the name of a biomedical class (e.g., an organ or anatomical entity) and a list of factual ontological knowledge statements associated with it.

Assume the input is an image that may contain multiple biomedical structures, including an instance of the specified class.

Your task is to create two sets of **yes/no** questions:
- `yes_questions`: Questions where the correct answer would be **"yes"** based on the provided ontological knowledge.
- `no_questions`: Questions where the correct answer would be **"no"** because the statement would not apply to the given object according to its ontology.

Each question must:
- Be answerable using both **visual cues** and **background ontological knowledge**
- Be phrased as a **yes/no** question
- Refer to the object **implicitly** (e.g., "an object", "something in the image")
- Be grounded either in the **presence** or **absence** of ontological features
- Avoid using the objectâ€™s class name directly in the question

Return your output as a JSON object with two keys: "yes_questions" and `"no_questions"`.
Each key should contain a JSON array of strings (questions).

Do not include any explanations.

Input Class: "Liver"
Ontological Knowledge: [
  "The Liver is classified under the superclasses [Organ, Gland].",
  "The Liver is part of the following organ systems [Digestive System, Hepatic System].",
  "The Liver is composed of cell types such as [Hepatocytes, Kupffer Cells, Endothelial Cells].",
  "The Liver performs biological functions including [Detoxification, Bile Production, Metabolism Regulation].",
  "The Liver is characterized by structural features such as [Lobules, Central Vein, Portal Triad].",
  "The Liver is associated with enzymes and pathways like [Cytochrome P450, Urea Cycle, Glycolysis].",
  "The Liver interacts with organs such as [Gallbladder, Stomach, Pancreas].",
  "Descriptive properties of the Liver include [Size, Weight, Texture, Color].",
  "Axioms that define the Liver include roles in [Metabolic Processing, Blood Filtration, Homeostasis]."
]

Output:
{{
  "yes_questions": [
    "Is there a structure in the image that might produce bile?",
    "Does the image show an organ that could be involved in detoxifying substances?",
    "Is there something in the image that is connected to the gallbladder?",
    "Does the image include a structure composed of lobules?",
    "Is there a part of the digestive system visible in the image?"
  ],
  
  "no_questions": [
    "Is there an object in the image that produces insulin?",
    "Does the image contain a structure that regulates neurotransmitters?",
    "Is there something in the image that could be a spinal cord segment?",
    "Is the object responsible for pumping blood?",
    "Does the image contain a gland of the endocrine system?"
  ]
