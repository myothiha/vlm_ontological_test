LLM Response: Task description:
You are given a question, a gold‐standard reference answer written by experts, and a candidate answer. Please rate the accuracy of the candidate answer for the question, considering the reference answer. Use a scale of 1–3, with:
 1 = incorrect or irrelevant answer  
 2 = ambiguous or incomplete answer  
 3 = correct answer  

Give the rationale before stating the rating.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: A binary question should only be answered with “yes” or “no”; any other answer to a binary question is incorrect.
Your output MUST be valid JSON with exactly two keys:  
  - `"rationale"`: a string explaining your reasoning  
  - `"rating"`: an integer (1, 2, or 3)
